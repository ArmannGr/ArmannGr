# About Me

Hello! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Armann Grewal, a passionate DevOps engineer with a strong background in Angular and Spring Boot for full-stack software development. I'm also well-versed in SQL databases like PostgreSQL and have extensive experience working with Kubernetes and GitOps tools such as FluxCD. I'm continually honing my skills in cloud topics, particularly Terraform, and I actively contribute to the AWS ecosystem.

## Professional Background

- **Full Stack Developer**: I have extensive experience in building robust and scalable web applications using Angular and Spring Boot. My proficiency in both frontend and backend technologies enables me to create end-to-end solutions with a seamless user experience.

- **Database Expertise**: I'm skilled in working with SQL databases, especially PostgreSQL. I have designed, optimized, and maintained database systems to ensure data integrity and application performance.

- **Kubernetes**: I'm well-versed in container orchestration using Kubernetes and FluxCD for GitOps workflows. I leverage these technologies to automate application deployment and manage infrastructure as code.

- **Cloud Enthusiast**: I'm committed to expanding my knowledge of cloud technologies, with a particular focus on Terraform. I believe in the power of Infrastructure as Code (IaC) to create scalable and maintainable cloud environments.

- **AWS Experience**: I actively work on AWS, leveraging its services to build cloud-native applications and infrastructure. I'm always eager to explore new AWS offerings and best practices.

## Academic Achievements

- **Bachelor's Thesis**: I completed my Bachelor's Thesis on the topic of "Evaluation of Security Aspects in DevOps with a Prototypical Implementation." In this thesis, I explored the critical intersection of development and security within the context of DevOps practices. I developed a prototype to assess and enhance security aspects in DevOps.
